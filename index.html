						<h2>Michael Jackson</h2>
						<p>Michael Joseph Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Known as the "King of Pop,"
							Michael Jackson was a best-selling American singer, songwriter and dancer. As a child, Jackson became
							the lead singer of his family's popular Motown group, the Jackson 5. He went on to a solo career of
							astonishing worldwide success, delivering No. 1 hits from the albums Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. In
							his later years, Jackson was dogged by allegations of child molestation. He died in 2009 at age 50 of a
							drug overdose just before launching a comeback tour.
							Jackson is the most awarded artist in the history of popular music and one of the best-selling music
							artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide. Thriller is the
							best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five Billboard Hot 100
							number-one singles. Jackson had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, more than any other male artist
							in the Hot 100 era, and was the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five
							different decades. He received 15 Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness
							World Records, including the "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the
							Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance
							Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In
							2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes.
